        <em>Goals</em>
        <p>
          The overall goal of this study is to test the learnability and possible errors of the mobile version of the app’s main features. I will observe and measure if users understand the purpose/value of the app, its navigation and how to complete the main functions.
        </p>
        <em>Test Objectives</em>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>What are participants’ reactions to the concept of the app?</li>
            <li>Do participants see value in the features of the app?</li>
            <li>Are participants able to successfully browse and read a blog article?</li>
            <li>Are participants able to successfully locate and practice an exercise?</li>
            <li>Do participants make errors? Are participants able to correct errors?</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <em>Methodology</em>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>preferred method: in-person</li>
            <li>remote method employed when necessary due to time and cost restraints.</li>

        </p>
        <em>Sessions</em>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>individually engage in 10-15 minute usability test sessions</li>
            <li>30 minutes will be set aside for each session for the tester in anticipation of possible questions about the study, technical issues, participants running late, etc.</li>

        <em>Preference Test</em>
        <p>
          Around this time, I received some <em>feedback about the background color</em> from my tutor and peers, I ran a <em>preference test to validate</em> this feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          With <em>overwhelmingly clear results</em>, I updated my prototype. I'm glad to have had the preference test results in hand - updating every page took much longer than expected and I may have given up halfway if I had not seen the data to prove this was absolutely the right choice.
